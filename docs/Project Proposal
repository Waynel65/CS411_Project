Proposal #1: Book Recommendation App
Our application returns a book recommendation based on the user’s music preferences. 
We first use the Spotify API to browse through the user’s playlists and find a general
mood and genre of music he/she likes possible through the Watson API. The results will
generate a random book title from one of the book API’s that has a similar genre category.


Proposal #2: Boston University Marketplace
Our “OfferUp”-esque application will facilitate trusted and safe C2C marketplace for Boston
University students. Users can only have access to these services if he/she has a BU email 
address. When an offer is accepted, an API will find a safe location for students to meet up. 
Reviews and User Ratings will be implemented after each successful transaction.
