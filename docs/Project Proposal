Proposal #1: Book Recommendation App
Our application returns a book recommendation based on the user’s music preferences. 
We first use the Spotify API to browse through the user’s playlists and find a general
mood or genre of music he/she likes possibly through the Watson API. Then, we will
generate a random book that has a similar genre category or mood from one of the book API’s.


Proposal #2: Boston University Marketplace
Our “OfferUp”-esque application will facilitate a trusted and safe C2C marketplace for Boston
University students. Users can only have access to these services if he/she has a BU email 
address. When an offer is accepted, an API will find a safe location for students to meet up. 
Reviews and User Ratings will be implemented after each successful transaction.
