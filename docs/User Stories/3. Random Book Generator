Random Book Generator:
“As a user, I want to find a book that suits the genre of music that
I listen to so that I know it adheres to my tastes.”

Happy Path:
After choosing the playlists from their Spotify account (refer to <Logging in>
story), the user will be shown a button that says “Generate Books.” Then, the web
page should return a list of 5 books that the algorithm believes are the most relevant
to the music genre the user likes. From there, the user can either choose a book to start
reading (refer to <Receiving the Book>) or they can hit the “Redo” button (refer to <Redo Button> story) to get a new list
of recommended books. 

Unhappy Path:
If the user does not like any of the books, they can choose to redo the book selections
by hitting the redo button.
