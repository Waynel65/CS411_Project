Receiving the Book: 
“As a user, I want to receive the book suggestions and have options on
the format I would like to read the book in so that I do not have to spend
a lot of time searching for it. I also want to be able to see which books are
strongly suggested so that I know which ones contain good content.”

Happy Path: The user will select a certain book title from the list of recommended
books that is generated from the website (see “Random Book Generator”). A dropdown
will provide a link to purchase the book online for the user along with a playable
Audible trial where the user can listen to a small portion of the audiobook to see
if they enjoy it. 

Unhappy Path: If the selected book does not have an audiobook from Audible available
and/or the book does not have any link to purchase it, then the user will be met with a
message that says “No Resources Available” and the ISBN number of the book will be given
to the user with a link to “isbnsearch.org .”
