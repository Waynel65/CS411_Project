Main User Story
“As a logged-in user, I want to get book recommendations from platforms such
as Amazon based on my Spotify music playlists so that I know the book is geared
towards my interests.”

Happy Path (when things go right): 
First, I will log into the website. If I am logging into the website for the
first time, I will be given an “interactive instructions” guide that guides me
through how the web-app works (refer to <Interactive Instructions> story). Then,
I will be prompted to sign into my Spotify account. After the sign-in process succeeds,
I will be prompted to choose a playlist (refer to <Logging In> story). Then, the system
will generate a list of five books that are recommended to me based on the playlist I chose
(refer to <Random Book Generator> story) as well as their average ratings. From there I can
click on the book I am interested in and be led to a place where I can get the book (refer
to <Receiving the Book>). If I do not like the books recommended, I can hit a refresh button
(refer to <Redo Button> story). After I finish reading the book, I can rate how much I like
it (refer to <Rating System> story).

Unhappy Path (when things go wrong)
Specified in each sub-story.
