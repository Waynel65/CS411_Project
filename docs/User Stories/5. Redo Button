Redo Button:
“As a user, once I get my list of books, I might have already
read some of them if I use the application a lot. I want to have
the option of getting more, different book recommendations.”

Happy Path:
Once the user receives their five recommended books, the refresh
button will appear. This button will allow them to essentially shuffle
their options and get five more books that fit in the same genre category.

Unhappy Path:
If the user does not like any of the options and keeps refreshing,
they will have five maximum refreshes. Once they hit this maximum,
they can have the system scan their music again for their second most
listened to genre of the same playlist or have it scan another playlist
and be offered another set of books (refer to “Random Book Generator” and
“Receiving the Book”)
