Rating System: 
“As a user, I want to see which books have been strongly
recommended by others so I know whether they are good books or not.”

Happy Path: (refer to "Logging In") After the user chooses a book, it will be remembered
in their profile. When the user finishes reading the book, they will
have the option to go to their profile and rate the book out of five
stars and leave a review. After ranking, there will be a short survey
to ask if they would like to have similar content or different genres
suggested. This will help us to improve the suggestion pattern for the users. 

Unhappy Path: If the user did not enjoy the content they listened to
or read and they left a poor rating (less than 3 stars), similar to
the “Happy Path” above, they will be given a short survey and be able
to leave a review to expand on why they did not enjoy the book and choose
whether they prefer different genres of books.
