Rating System: 
“As a user, I want to see which books have been strongly
recommended by others so I know whether they are good books or not.”

Happy Path: (refer to "Logging In" and "Random Book Generator" user stories) After the user receive a book choice, they will
be provided with a link to the Google Book's page for the book. Here, they can see if
the book has good ratings and they will also have an opportunity to see if they like the book or 
not by reading some of the sample pages in the book.

Unhappy Path: If the user does not like the book, they can just go back and hit the refresh button. (refer to "Refresh Button")

Why Changed:
We took out the internal rating system because Google Books already comes with it inherently.
