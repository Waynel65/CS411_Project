Random Book Generator:
“As a user, I want to find a book that suits the genre of music that
I listen to so that I know it adheres to my tastes.”

Happy Path:
(Refer to "Log In") After logging in with their Spotify account, the user will be shown a button that says “Generate Books.” Then, the web
page should return a book that the algorithm believes is relevant
to the music genre the user likes along with a link to the Google Books page for the book. From there, the user can either choose to start reading the book
or they can hit the refresh button (refer to <Refresh Button> story) to get a new recommended book. 

Unhappy Path:
If the user does not like any of the books, they can choose to redo the book selections
by hitting the refresh button.
