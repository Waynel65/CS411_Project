Logging In:
“As a user, I want to log into the application and make sure I am using my own Spotify
account so that I can personalize the recommendation of books.”

Happy Path:
The user will be met with a "Welcome" page prompting them to log in through their Spotify account.
Once their Spotify account is authenticated, the user has the option of choosing if they would like a book recommendation
based on their top playlist and music genre. 

Unhappy Path:
If the user does not have a Spotify account, they will be prompted to make a Spotify account and a playlist
with all of their favorite songs. The genre of music that they prefer should in theory be similar to that of
their favorite songs so this allows the user to quickly get a book recommendation without having to listen to
too much music.
