Redo Button:
“As a user, once I get my book suggestion, I might have already
read some of them if I use the application a lot. I want to have
the option of getting more, different book recommendations.”

Happy Path:
The user can hit the refresh part of the browser to get a new book suggestion.

Unhappy Path:
If the user does not like any of the options and keeps refreshing,
they might have to log in with a different account or make another playlist a top playlist.
