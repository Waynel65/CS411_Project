Main User Story
“As a logged-in user, I want to get book recommendations from platforms such
as Google Books based on my Spotify music playlists so that I know the book is geared
towards my interests.”

Happy Path (when things go right): 
First, I will log into the website. (refer to "Log In" user story) 
If it is my first time logging on, I will be prompted to sign into my Spotify account. 
If I don't have a Spotify account, I will be prompted to make one. After the sign-in process succeeds,
I will be prompted to choose whether I want to generate a book related to my favorite music genre
and top playlist. Then, the system will generate a book related to my favorite music genre. From there I can
click on the displayed link for the recommended book. (refer to "Resources") If I do not like the books recommended, I can hit the refresh
button on the browser and get a new book suggestion. (refer to "Refresh Button")


Unhappy Path (when things go wrong)
Specified in each sub-story.
