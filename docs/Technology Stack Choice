When deciding which tech stack to choose, we narrowed our decision to two choices: Node and Flask. Although both are quite useful in our scenario,
we decided that it was in our best interest to use Flask. The members of our group who worked on the backend were more familiar with this framework
and felt that it served our purpose the best. Furthermore, Flask is written in Python and we were all more familiar with Python than JavaScript.
